Cathepsin ligands example:
--------------------------

This directory contains 6 Cathepsin ligands which where docked to ttlcCatS_5_GC3.pdb.
The docking was done not retaining the water molecules of the crystal structure.
The ligands from part of the Free energy set of GC4 and would be expected to bind
in a similar way. (Conservation of binding mode). This is achieved if the crystal
waters are retained for docking, but sometimes such information is not available and
it would still be necessary to compute MCS for these structures and potentially raise
a warning that you are trying to do a Free energy perturbation between ligands whose binding
modes are very different from each other.

Subsequently it would be great if there was something available that would allow
all other ligands to be forced onto a binding mode, particularly if the MCS overlap
is very large and therefore only changes are the arrangements of small side chains.
