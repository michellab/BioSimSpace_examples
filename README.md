# BioSimSpace Examples

This repository contains example `.pdb` files that successful pass through tleap ( [Ambertools](http://ambermd.org/AmberTools.php) ) providing full input and output for a command line use of tleap. These serve as test cases and examples that can be used for setting up systems with BioSimSpace. 

Directory structure:    

    protein   
      |---input    
            |----input files needed for tleap   
      |---output   
            |---- output generated for tleap
        
In the `input` directory contains all necessary information needed for running tleap and the `output` shows the example output generated by running the input commands. Command line arguments should be place in a file called `command.txt` and the input `input.txt`.
